   - Add/Update/Delete Resident Profiles: Manage the `Person` entity, capturing details like `Person_ID`, `Gender`, `IsSoloParent`, `IsSeniorCitizen`.
   - Resident Search and Filtering: Search residents based on personal attributes such as `Gender` or their special statuses (e.g., `IsSoloParent`).
   - Link Residents to Households: A `Person` can be assigned as the `HouseholdHead_ID` in the `Household` entity, linking individuals to their respective households.

2. Household Management (`Household`)
   - Add/Update/Delete Households: Manage the `Household` entity with details like `Household_ID`, `Address`, and `numberOfMembers`.

3. Barangay Officials and Staff Management (`Official`)
   - Add/Update/Delete Barangay Officials: Manage the `Official` entity, capturing details like `Official_ID`, `Name`, `Position`, and the officialâ€™s term duration (`termStart`, `termEnd`).

4. Incident and Case Reporting (`Complaints`, `Blotter`)
   - Report Incidents: Use the `Complaints` and `Blotter` entities to track incidents with fields such as `dateFiled`, `IncidentDate`, `complaintDetails`, `IncidentDetails`, and `Status`.

    - Activity Logs: Implement a mechanism to track changes made across entities like `Complaints`, `Blotter`, `Clearances`, and `Businesses` to ensure traceability and accountability.

11. Reports and Analytics
